# 👋 Hi there! I'm Pedro

I'm a Full Stack Developer with a background in aerospace prototyping and maintenance. After years of working hands-on with aircraft systems and next-gen flight technologies at companies like Volocopter and ERC-System, I decided to channel my problem-solving mindset into the world of software and web development.

Recently, I completed an intensive Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at 4Geeks Academy, where I built full-stack applications using modern technologies and best practices.

## ✈️ Aerospace Engineering Background

Before becoming a developer, I worked on aircraft systems and prototyping:
- Cabin modifications on British Airways’ A320 fleet (Cobra Aeronautics)  
- Prototyping and flight testing at Volocopter (Germany)  
- Prototype development at ERC-System (Munich)

This experience taught me precision, teamwork, and adaptability—skills I now apply to building clean, efficient, and user-friendly code.
